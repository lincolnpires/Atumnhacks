# Video Chat idea

## Feats

- [ ] Video/call
  - [ ] Multi-user
- [ ] Chat
- [ ] Screen sharing
- [ ] Task list
- [ ] Timer/Pomodoro
- [ ] Reward system for completed task/timer
---
- [ ] this will be a web app or google chrome extension for easy access
- [ ] study room has 3 routes:
  - [ ] join random public rooms with strangers,
  - [ ] join a room through code generated by teachers/ qr code or
  - [ ] create your private room and invite friends
- [ ] when you enter in your tasks that need to be done and when you complete the task there will be a reward.
- [ ] In a private room the reward is set up by you.  
For example: read 1 hour and reward is a *cookie*.  
A `pop up` at 45 minutes will say *"15 minutes left and you can have a cookie"*.  
- [ ] If the room is created by strangers or teachers, the rewards will be set up by them for you to collect and that reward can show on screen or *unknown* until task is done.
- [ ] chat is to discuss and *ask others* questions
- [ ] video call function we discussed that if the room is limit to around 10-20 people then that will be active else disabled
- [ ]  have an option to change theme/color of the room

### Ops Point of View

- need peer to peer connections, which is complicated given NAT, VPNs etc.
  - Lucky us, there's [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) these days
  - Might Need a Stun Server - I know there's AWS Chime, but it costs
    - [ ] Google `Free Stun Servers` or trial ones
  - [ ] Might Need a TURN Server (because of the first point) - I know there's AWS Chime, but it costs
    - [ ] - [ ] Google `Free TURN Servers` or trial ones
- Need a DB to store some information, can't use only LocalStorage/IndexedDB (pick only 1):
  - [ ] CockroachDB?
  - [ ] Firebase? (going w/ Google)
  - [ ] CosmosDB? (if going w/ Azure as infra)
- Better to use Full `JS`, in case of explicit server side, go Node
- Front-end: for fast prototype and trying an MVP I suggest
  - [ ] Bootstrap for Styling and components
  - [ ] Either Vanilla JS or React as lib - otherwise, a very easy and simple lib
- Back-end:
  - If going with Firebase, I don't think we need a server-side for DB ops
  - Never coded `Chat`, need to investigate to see what's best and how.
    - Is there an API we can use already?
  - It seems that we need a DB/tables for storing `Rooms` information
- Infrastructure
  - [ ] Azure üòÄ
  - [ ] -AWS- ü§î
  - [ ] Cloudflare üòê
  - [ ] Digital Ocean üôÇ
  - [ ] Firebase üôÇ


# MVP - Something to present
In order for us to have something that can be demoed, we need to cut corners.
Suggested Scope:
- *1 on 1* video at first, otherwise it might get complicated to add 3 or more users at the same time.
- simple chat w/ no @mentions or emojis
- Tasks and Rewards seems to be differentiator of our app, so a basic Task list for each room and a Reward
  - For the reward, I picture there's a reedeem option (in case is a voucher or something)
- Also the different types of rooms
